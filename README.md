Christmas Face Detector and Carol Player
<br>
1. Description<br>
This Python script combines face detection with a Christmas carol player. It utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection, Pygame for audio playback, and multithreading for a seamless user experience. The program detects faces through a USB camera and plays a Christmas carol when a face is detected. The carol plays for an extended duration, creating a festive atmosphere.<br>
