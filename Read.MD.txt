Christmas Face Detector and Carol Player

1. Description
This Python script combines face detection with a Christmas carol player. It utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection, Pygame for audio playback, and multithreading for a seamless user experience. The program detects faces through a USB camera and plays a Christmas carol when a face is detected. The carol plays for an extended duration, creating a festive atmosphere.

2. Features
- Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's face cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time.
- Christmas Carol Playback: Plays a Christmas carol ('carol.mp3') using Pygame when a face is detected.
- Timer Functionality: Uses a timer thread to control the duration of carol playback.
- User Interface: Displays detected faces with rectangles and provides debug messages.
- Merry Christmas Message: Displays a "Merry Christmas!" message while the carol is playing.
